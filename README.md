**"website-v2?" what is this?**

This is my portfolio page to introduce myself to people who visit my website.

*website-v1 can be found here: https://github.com/soooolooo/website-v1*

**Why did you create another version of the portfolio website?**

I wanted to practice more coding with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). So I re-created my portfolio webpage.

**I've noticed you have folders called "v1" & "v2", Why did you include them?**

Showing off my steps of re-designing my portfolio website from scratch and what I ended up with. The final version I call it "v3".
